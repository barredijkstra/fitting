Fitting
=======

Fitting is a "framework" that provides fixtures for [Fitnesse](http://www.fitnesse.org/) to facilitate UI testing using an uniform DSL.
By using an uniform DSL that describes standard UI elements and operations instead of UI implementation specific ones, it is possible to run the same test
on for example a web interface, a desktop client or a mobile application by just switching the reference of the used implementation component.

The project is written in Java and compiled to Java version 1.6.
